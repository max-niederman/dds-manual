Sitting outside the robots frame perimeter, they are susceptible to damage from collisions with the field and other robots. All OTB intake designs are heavily influenced by the design requirements to be robust against impacts and damage, fast, and light.</p>  Always include a way to tension your chains!  OTB intakes must actuate quickly and accurately, so a motor is a good choice to power them. 1678 used a single Falcon 500 with a 30:1 ratio. This intake featured a torque transfer shaft (highlighted yellow in the image) to transfer power to both sides of the intake. Driving both sides of the intake pivot prevents the entire intake from bending under the loads of extension and retraction. The pivot itself is driven by chain on a 32t plate sprocket. Using a chain for the final reduction and power transmission is optimal due to its ability to absorb shock loads.  These screws and washers prevent bearings from popping out during impacts.   The intake rollers are powered by a Falcon 500, and power is transferred using HTD 5mm timing belts. The intake is designed with the \"touch it own it\" design philosophy, and it spans the full width of the robot to make intaking as easy as possible for the driver. The intake is \"geared\" (using belt and pulley reductions) so that the surface speed of the rollers are approximately 2.5x the speed of the robot. This allows the robot to intake balls even while driving into them at full speed. Each level of wheels is also belted together such that they have equal surface speeds, despite their different diameters.  It is important to take the diameter of your intake wheels/rollers into account because it may effect their surface speeds. <p>This intake takes many special considerations to increase its survivability and robustness</p> The first stage of rollers has two belts powering it for redundancy, just in case one belt is damaged. Pulleys feature extra-large flanges to prevent belts from slipping off. Intake plates are manufactured from 1/4\" polycarbonate, which is the most common intake material due to its strength to weight ratio and ability to return to its original shape after deforming. This intake has extra aluminum reinforcement on the areas most susceptible to breaking. Intake hardstopped in its down position. Intake hardstopped in its up position <p> 1678 designed their intake polycarbonate plates to hardstop on each other in both the fully extended and retracted positions. This makes programming the intake easier, and helps the robot pass inspection by proving that the intake cannot extend past the frame perimeter extension limit. In a pneumatically actuated intake, having the pivot plates hardstop allows for some error margin on the pneumatic piston's stroke.</p>"},{"location":"cad-examples/intake/4bar/examples/1678/#see-this-intake-in-action-here","title":"<p> See this Intake in Action Here </p>","text":"1678 Behind the Bumpers 1678 Match Video"},{"location":"cad-examples/intake/4bar/examples/clean/","title":"Andrew's Clean 4 Bar Intake","text":""},{"location":"cad-examples/intake/4bar/examples/clean/#andrews-clean-4-bar","title":"Andrew's Clean 4 Bar","text":"Motor driven 4 bar intake designed to be as simple as possible, utilizing deadaxle rollers"},{"location":"cad-examples/intake/4bar/examples/clean/#behind-the-design","title":"Behind the Design","text":"<p>Coming Soon</p>"},{"location":"cad-examples/intake/4bar/examples/vaughn4bar/","title":"Vaughn's 4 Bar Intake","text":""},{"location":"cad-examples/intake/4bar/examples/vaughn4bar/#vaughns-4bar-intake","title":"Vaughn's 4bar Intake","text":"Motor driven 4 bar intake designed to be as simple as possible, utilizing deadaxle rollers"},{"location":"cad-examples/intake/4bar/examples/vaughn4bar/#behind-the-design","title":"Behind the design","text":"<p>Coming Soon</p>"},{"location":"cad-examples/intake/slapdown/","title":"Index","text":""},{"location":"cad-examples/intake/slapdown/#slapdown-intakes","title":"Slapdown Intakes","text":"<p>The slapdown style of \"Over the Bumper\" intakes is very common in situations where your packaging is constrained horizontally, but not vertically.</p> <p>Here is our collection of slapdown intakes:</p> <ul> <li>4414 Style Intake</li> <li>Washed's Beavertail Intake</li> <li>Low Pivot Slapdown Intake</li> <li>6423 Crecendo Flip Intake</li> </ul>"},{"location":"cad-examples/intake/slapdown/examples/4414style/","title":"4414 Style  Intake","text":""},{"location":"cad-examples/intake/slapdown/examples/4414style/#4414-style-slapdown-intake","title":"4414 Style Slapdown Intake","text":"A coaxial slapdown design popularized by Team 4414 | HighTide"},{"location":"cad-examples/intake/slapdown/examples/4414style/#behind-the-design","title":"Behind the design","text":"<p>Coming Soon</p>"},{"location":"cad-examples/intake/slapdown/examples/6423otb/","title":"6423 Crescendo Slapdown Intake","text":""},{"location":"cad-examples/intake/slapdown/examples/6423otb/#6423-crescendo-flip-intake","title":"6423 Crescendo Flip Intake","text":"This common 2024 design was inspired by the ri3d team Cranberry Alarm.

These can be broken down to the following ideas: </p> <ul> <li>Maximize contact time with the game piece you are shooting. This benefits shot consistency as it gives the gamepiece more time to match the speed of the flywheels. </li> <li>Ensure your shooter can aim with adequate precision.</li> <li>Ensure your flywheels have enough mass to hold a consistent speed throughout the shot.</li> <li>In some cases, spin can be beneficial.</li> </ul> <p>Learn more about the 2022 game: Rapid React</p>  Hooded shooters in 2022 featured backrollers for one main purpose: Controlling backspin. A unique aspect of the 2022 game was the high goal that robots were required to shoot into. The geometry of the goal led many teams to find that their shots bounced out with high backspin. As a remedy, teams added backrollers to their shooters that were geared to spin in the opposite direction as the main flywheel. This reduced backspin on the balls to a manageable amount, but in some cases left just a little bit. This is due to the aerodynamics of spinning balls; thanks to the Magnus effect, backspin on rapid react balls helped them arc better into the high goal, and increased their stability in flight for long distance shots. Hooded shooter flywheels typically use TTB Urethane Wheels or Stealth Wheels. It is important that your flywheels maintain enough mass to hold a constant speed throughout the shot, to ensure consistent shots. Increasing the mass of your flywheel will increase it's moment of inertia, which in turn will increase its consistency. Games in which you can hold and shoot multiple pieces at a time such as Rapid React and Infinite Recharge especially necessitate massed flywheels. The 1678 shooter in 2022 utilized two SDS flywheels for its mass.  The most common method of pivoting a hooded shooter is a rack and pinion. 1678 utilized a 3DP rack integrated with their shooter's \"hood,\" and a smaller gear that \"climbed\" the hood gear. This simple design allows for precise actuation of the hood to a wide range of angles."},{"location":"cad-examples/shooter/examples/citrus/#see-this-shooter-in-action-here","title":"<p> See this Shooter in Action Here </p>","text":"1678 Behind the Bumpers 1678 Match Video"},{"location":"cad-examples/shooter/examples/small/","title":"Andrew's Hyper-Hive Shooter","text":""},{"location":"cad-examples/shooter/examples/small/#andrews-hyperhive-shooter","title":"Andrew's Hyperhive Shooter","text":"Small form factor shooter designed to shoot a high volume of tennis balls at a fast rate.

In this case, an \u201cextrude\u201d feature is used to extend the profile of the sketch into 3D space. Just like how we defined the sketch, we define the characteristics of this extrude. For example, we must specify a \u201cdepth\u201d or final \u201cheight\u201d for the cylinder. This is used to create the final geometry. There are many such settings we must specify when using features.</p> <p>We can always add additional sketches and features to add more complex geometry to our parts, or to create additional parts within the part studio. We can also use features that don\u2019t require a sketch, to round or chamfer corners or add specific geometry. </p> <p>These are the fundamentals of basic part design in Onshape.</p>"},{"location":"design-guide/stages/stage0/0D-theory/#to-recap","title":"To recap:","text":"<ul> <li>Create a new sketch within a new part studio</li> <li>Define the sketch with constraints</li> <li>Transform the sketch into a 3D object with specified features</li> <li>Manipulate the part with additional features </li> <li>Repeat these steps until the part is complete</li> </ul> <p>Remember: One \u201cpart studio\u201d can have multiple, even many different parts.

(Editor\u2019s note: the use of unsimplified models is deliberate, will use simplfied models in 2B Project. ) In this project we will go step-by-step as we introduce new concepts. Remember to apply the skills you have already learned.</p> <p></p> <p>It is important to learn how to design a swerve drive base since it is the most commonly used competitive drivetrain in FRC, and everything you design goes on top of it. </p> <p>Note</p> <p>Notice how it\u2019s made out of aluminum box tubing. You\u2019ll find that this is most common \u201cstructural\u201d part. You can think of this like the bricks for a house. Box tubing use used in everything, it is most commonly found in 2 inch by 1 inch, 1 inch by 1 inch, and 2 inch by 2 inch sizes. It is also found in 1/8 inch and 1/16 inch thicknesses.</p> <p>Note</p> <p>For the rest of the tutorial, box tubing will be referred to by their shorthand name (based on their size), such as 2x1, 1x1, and 2x2.</p> <p>A swerve drivebase is composed of four swerve modules. Each module has a motor which is used to power and steer the wheel. This allows you to move in any direction.</p> <p>To start, we will be making a sketch on the right plane. This will be representing the right side of our robot and help us determine the length of the drive train. Name the sketch \u201cRobot Layout\u201d </p> <p></p> <p>Make a center point rectangle and do a vertical constraint on the center point of the rectangle to the origin point. (The black and white circle) Make the rectangle 2 inches high. This rectangle represents the box tube that you saw above. Then dimension the rectangle 1.75 inches above the origin. </p> <p>Now we have a drivetrain side of unknown length, that is 2 inches wide and 1.75 inches above the ground</p> <p></p> <p>Let\u2019s define the length of the drivetrain. We can do this by dimensioning the rectangle to a set size, we\u2019ll do 26.</p> <p></p> <p>This means that our drivebase is 26 inches long.</p> <p>To make things a bit easier, let\u2019s also draw our wheels.</p> <p></p> <p>We can do this by making a 3 inch rectangle that is constrained horizontally to the origin (the wheel raises the drivetrain by 1.75 inches). We can then make a mirror line by drawing a line in the center, then mirroring as so.</p> <p>Now, let\u2019s make the whole thing construction. We\u2019ll be using this as a reference point to define the length and width of the square drivetrain. If we need to change the chassis dimensions, we can go back to \u201cRobot Layout\u201d and change it.</p> <p></p> <p>Let\u2019s confirm the sketch.</p> <p>Now we\u2019ll be modeling the drivetrain tubes. We\u2019ll be ending with something that looks like this.</p> <p></p> <p>Note</p> <p>Notice how the part studio has all the tubes of the drive train shown here.</p> <p>Make a plane and set the plane as \u201cline angle\u201d</p> <p></p> <p>Then click the line on the bottom of the drivetrain sketch that we made before. (Click the the highlighted line)</p> <p></p> <p>Then, press the checkmark and confirm the plane. Planes allow us to create sketches that are placed away from the original starting planes. Let\u2019s now make a sketch, making the sketch plane the new plane we just created. You can do this by clicking the plane.</p> <p></p> <p>Now, press the \u201cTop\u201d button on the view cube and get a top view. For our next steps we\u2019ll be viewing directly from the top, sketching out the \u201ctop\u201d of the drivetrain tubes. </p> <p></p> <p>Start by making a center point rectangle, then dragging out once you highlight the top edge of the dotted line. If you remember previously, that edge was the edge of your drivetrain which you defined as the length of the drivetrain. See how the left side of the rectangle is already 26 inches! We want to make this a square, so let\u2019s use the equal constraint (e key), then press the top of the square and the left side of the square. This should make both sides equal to each other, and the whole sketch should be black.</p> <p></p> <p>Use the offset tool and offset the square inwards by 1 inch, this will define the side of your drive rails.</p> <p>Taking a look at the swerve drivetrain again, we can see there\u2019s a cutout in each of the corners. We should define this in our sketch. From the edge of the corner, the gap is 4.25 inches long. </p> <p></p> <p>Draw two lines, one horizontally constrained and one vertically constrained and dimension them 4.25 as shown on one of the corners</p> <p></p> <p>Then, Circular pattern the two lines you created, changing the pattern to four. It should look like this:</p> <p></p> <p>Confirming the sketch should show the chassis as shown, with some blue lines. Why is that? </p> <p></p> <p>If you click on one of the points on the blue unconstrained lines, you can drag them around. This also reveals the center of rotation of the circular pattern</p> <p></p> <p>Constrain the center of rotation to the origin using the coincident tool. </p> <p>Your sketch should look something like this now.</p> <p></p> <p>If we take the top view of a drivetrain, you can see how it looks similar. Removing the modules also shows the gaps we modeled.</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>Let\u2019s now sketch out the middle cross beam. We\u2019ll make this out of 2x2 aluminum since 2x2 is stronger than 2x1.</p> <p></p> <p>Let\u2019s make it 2 inches wide, and 2 inches away from the center (origin).</p> <p>Now, let\u2019s confirm the sketch. You can also rename the sketch to \u201cDrivetrain Top\u201d </p> <p>Now, lets create the tubes. Click the extrude individual featurescript. Extrude individual allows us to make multiple parts, one per sketch reason, with a single extrude feature.</p> <p></p> <p>Click the top faces of the sketch, and extrude.</p> <p></p> <p>Now use the tube converter featurescript and click on the four outer tubes.</p> <p></p> <p>We need to set the thickness as 0.125, as 0.125 thickness is \u201cthick wall\u201d tubing. 0.125 thick tubes are strong and allow for a strong and rigid frame that is resistant to collisions. Set 2 inch face style to \u201c1 inch between holes\u201d, and click the checkbox for center row. You can find this type of box tubing on various COTS vendors, which sell the pre-punched tubing for your convenience.</p> <p></p> <p>(Source: West Coast Products)</p> <p>Now confirm the tube converter.</p> <p>Let\u2019s do another tube converter for the 2x2 tube, but change the thickness to 1/16. The reason for this is because 1/16 2x2 is plenty strong, and allows for weight savings down the line.</p> <p>Once you are done, change the appearance of all of your tubes to a color of your choosing. I\u2019ll be using dark gray. You can do this by going to the parts menu and clicking all 5 parts, then right clicking and selecting \u201cedit appearance for 5 parts\u201d</p> <p></p> <p> 1B: Swerve Drivebase &lt; 1A: Sketching &amp; Part Design 1C: Gearbox Projects &gt; </p>"},{"location":"design-guide/stages/stage1/1C-gearboxes/","title":"C: Gearbox Projects","text":""},{"location":"design-guide/stages/stage1/1C-gearboxes/#1c-gearbox-projects","title":"1C: Gearbox Projects","text":"<p>&lt; 1B: Swerve Drivebase Stage 2 &gt; </p>"},{"location":"design-guide/stages/stage1/1C-gearboxes/#gearbox-1","title":"Gearbox 1","text":"<p>This first gearbox introduces you to some basic ideas.

The part studio should contain all parts that need to be manufactured by your team. This could include fully custom plates, shafts cut to length, modified COTs parts, etc. However, unmodified COTs parts should be imported directly into the coresponding assembly - no modification inside the part studio is required.</p> <p>Important</p> <p>Never pattern or mirror parts in part studios that don't explicitly need to be patterned. Creating one of each part in the studio means you can simply duplicate it when assembling, and you part studio regenration time will be greatly reduced at no cost.</p> <p>Often, you only need to have one part studio and one top-level subsystem assembly, although depending on the complexity of the subsystem you may want to split into multiple. For example, you could split an elevator document into one part studio and coresponding assembly for each stage.

In your drivebase, you want to add something to increase the rigidity, such as a cross rail.
